Project Title: Scheduler

Description: Simple scheduling website with real-time tracking of time and events, alongside an input box that saves to local storage. With the day.js API, we can have a website that will update accordingly to the current time, which enables us to have past, present, and future events updated dinamically, enhancing the user experience.

How to Use: There is no installation required. You can access the project using the provided link. Simply add a description about an event in the input box that matches your desired time, and save with the save button. If your event is in a past time, it will be shown with a gray background. If it is current, it will be shown with a red background, and if it future, it will be shown with a green background.
